In this I am going to learn Generative AI with the help of Langchain.

Most of the notes will be handwritten and i will upload them later but each section will also contain a Small markdown which will demonstrate some parts which will be necessary.

## **Setup for the Code**

I am using UV for package management you can use pip also.

- run `uv init` or create venv manually
- `uv sync` to install required packages
- verify langchain by printing `print(langchain.__version__)`
